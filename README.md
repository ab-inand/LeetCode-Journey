### ## About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as a log of my progress and problem-solving process through LeetCode. Each solution is my own attempt and includes explanations on the approach, time complexity, and space complexity. The goal is not just to solve problems, but to understand the underlying patterns and master the art of algorithmic thinking. üß†

### ## My Approach to Problem Solving

1.  **Understand:** Read the problem carefully, identifying constraints and edge cases.
2.  **Plan:** Whiteboard a brute-force solution, then optimize. Analyze time and space complexities.
3.  **Implement:** Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
4.  **Review & Refactor:** Review the solution for improvements and refactor for clarity and efficiency.
